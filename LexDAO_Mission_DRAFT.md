#LexDAO Mission Statement - LexDAO is a [WYOMING, IDAHO, DC] U.S based unicorporated non-profit association of legal engineering professionals.  Our mission is to educate, reasearch and provide a trusted layer between the decentralized world of blockchains and a legal settlement layer in the real world.
